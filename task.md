# Shopping Advisor - Project Task Breakdown

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Build a mobile application that optimizes grocery shopping by analyzing users' shopping lists against local store prices, membership costs, travel expenses, and time investment.

**Total Timeline**: 24 months from start to national rollout
**Budget Target**: $0-50/month for MVP development, scale up only when profitable

## Free Development Strategy
**Philosophy**: Build and validate with free tools first, upgrade only when we have users and revenue

### Free Alternatives We'll Use:
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL with Docker (free)
- **Maps**: OpenStreetMap with Leaflet (free vs Google Maps $200+/month)
- **OCR**: Tesseract.js (free vs AWS Textract $100+/month)  
- **Hosting**: Railway/Render free tier (free vs AWS $200+/month)
- **Authentication**: Firebase free tier (25,000 users free)
- **Gas Prices**: Free APIs or web scraping (vs GasBuddy API $50+/month)
- **Monitoring**: Console logs + free tier tools (vs DataDog $100+/month)

### Upgrade Path (Only When Profitable):
1. **Phase 1**: 100% free development and testing
2. **Phase 2**: Add paid services only when we have 1,000+ active users
3. **Phase 3**: Scale infrastructure only when making $1,000+/month revenue
