Product Requirements Document: Shopping Advisor App
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for the "Shopping Advisor" mobile application. The primary goal of this application is to empower consumers to make the most cost-effective grocery purchasing decisions by providing real-time (or near real-time) price comparisons across local stores, considering not just item prices but also the associated costs of travel (gas, time, vehicle wear-and-tear).
1.2 Vision
To become the indispensable tool for smart shoppers, transforming how individuals approach grocery shopping by optimizing their spending, minimizing hidden costs, and maximizing savings.
1.3 Goals
* Empower Savings: Enable users to consistently find the lowest cumulative cost for their grocery basket.
* Reduce Hidden Costs: Educate users on the total cost of a shopping trip, including travel expenses.
* Streamline Decision-Making: Provide clear, actionable insights for shopping choices (which store, or which combination of stores).
* Personalization: Adapt to individual user preferences and historical shopping patterns.
* User Engagement: Foster a user-friendly and intuitive experience that encourages regular use.
1.4 Target Audience
Cost-conscious individuals, families, and anyone looking to optimize their grocery budget. This includes:
* Individuals with store memberships (e.g., Costco, Sam's Club) seeking to validate membership value.
* Shoppers who frequent multiple grocery stores (e.g., Walmart, Hy-Vee) and want to identify the cheapest options for specific items or entire lists.
* Users who value convenience but are willing to make informed decisions for significant savings.
2. Problem Statement
Many consumers lack a clear understanding of the true cost of their grocery purchases, often neglecting factors beyond the shelf price. Key challenges include:
* Price Opacity: Difficulty in comparing individual item prices across numerous local stores without physically visiting each one.
* Membership ROI: Uncertainty for store club members regarding how many purchases are needed to offset membership fees and achieve genuine savings compared to non-member stores. And if its worth it and at what point is it actually worth it based on their shopping pattern
* Hidden Travel Costs: Underestimation of the financial impact of travel (gas consumption, vehicle mileage depreciation, time) when choosing a cheaper distant store over a slightly more expensive but closer alternative.
* Inefficient Multi-Store Shopping: Lack of tools to intelligently split a grocery list across multiple stores for optimal savings, while accounting for inter-store travel costs.
* Generic List to Specific Product Mapping: Users often create generic grocery lists ("Milk," "Bread"), making accurate price comparison challenging without knowing the exact brand, size, and type.
3. Solution Overview: The Shopping Advisor App
The Shopping Advisor will be a mobile application that allows users to create and manage their grocery lists. Utilizing their geolocation, the app will:
1. Identify nearby grocery stores.
2. Provide price comparisons for items on their list across these stores.
3. Calculate the total cost of a shopping trip, including estimated gas consumption, travel time, and vehicle mileage depreciation.
4. Suggest optimal shopping strategies, including single-store trips or splitting purchases across multiple stores, always with a clear breakdown of the total estimated cost.
5. Employ a "Smart Clarification System" to translate generic user inputs into specific product matches for accurate pricing.
4. Key Features & Functionality
4.1 User Onboarding & Profile Setup
* Geolocation Access: Prompt user for permission to access their location for local store identification.
* Vehicle Details: Allow users to input their vehicle's make, model, and estimated MPG/fuel efficiency for accurate gas cost calculations. (Alternatively, a simpler "average MPG" or manual input of "cost per mile" can be offered).
* Home Address/Frequent Location: Allow users to set a default starting point for shopping trips.
4.2 Grocery List Management
* 4.2.1 Manual Item Entry & Smart Clarification System
o Intelligent Default: When a user types a generic item (e.g., "Milk," "Bread," "Coffee"), the app will automatically default to the most common, store-brand, or cheapest standard option available in the pricing database (e.g., "Great Value 1% Milk Gallon").
o Transparent Assumption: The default selection will be clearly displayed next to the item (e.g., "Milk (Great Value, 1% Gallon)").
o Quick Interactive Refinement: Tapping on a defaulted item will open a quick-selection panel with tappable filters (e.g., Brand, Type, Size, Organic/Conventional) to allow users to refine their choice quickly without scrolling through long lists.
o Product Image (Visual Confirmation): Display a small product image (if available from pricing API) for visual confirmation of the selected item.
o Quantity Input: Allow users to specify the quantity for each item (e.g., "2 Gallons," "3 lbs").
* 4.2.2 Barcode Scanning for Item Addition
o Enable users to scan a product's UPC/EAN barcode using their device's camera.
o The app will query a product database to retrieve exact product details (name, brand, size, image) and add it to the list.
* 4.2.3 Receipt Scanning for List Population & Learning
o Allow users to photograph their physical grocery receipts.
o Utilize OCR technology (via a third-party API) to extract store name, date, and individual line items (product, quantity, price).
o Automatically add recognized items to a "Past Purchases" history and prompt to add them to "Your Usuals."
o Identify specific brands/types from receipts to improve the "Your Usuals" personalization.
o Provide an interface for users to correct any OCR recognition errors.
* 4.2.4 "Your Usuals" for Quick Add
o Maintain a personalized list of frequently purchased and preferred items ("Your Usuals").
o When a user types an item already in "Your Usuals," the app will automatically suggest their preferred specific product.
o One-tap adding of items from "Your Usuals" to the current grocery list.
4.3 Store Discovery & Price Comparison
* 4.3.1 Local Store Identification: Based on user's current or specified location, identify and list up to 10 closest relevant grocery stores (configurable by user).
* 4.3.2 "Cheapest Basket" Suggestion:
o For each identified store, calculate the total cost of all items on the user's grocery list.
o Highlight the store(s) offering the lowest total basket price.
* 4.3.3 Detailed Price Comparison Table:
o Generate a clear, sortable table displaying:
* Each item on the grocery list.
* The price of that specific item at each suggested store.
* The total cost of the entire basket for each suggested store.
* Note if an item is out of stock or unavailable at a particular store.
4.4 Cost-Benefit & Trip Optimization
* 4.4.1 Travel Time & Distance Calculation: For each suggested store, calculate the estimated round-trip distance and driving time from the user's location.
* 4.4.2 Gas Cost Estimation: Based on distance, user's vehicle MPG (or average), and current local gas prices (from an API), estimate the total gas cost for the trip to each store.
* 4.4.3 Vehicle Mileage Depreciation Estimation: Provide an estimated cost for vehicle wear-and-tear per mile driven (based on user input or a general average).
* 4.4.4 Single-Store vs. Multi-Store Split Purchase Analysis:
o Single-Store Optimization: Show the most cost-effective single store including basket price + travel costs.
o Split Purchase Optimization: Analyze if splitting the grocery list across 2-3 (configurable) stores yields greater savings, even after factoring in travel costs between stores and back to the user's location.
o Detailed Breakdown: If a split purchase is suggested, provide a clear itinerary (e.g., "Go to Store A for items X, Y. Then drive to Store B for items Z, W. Total Savings: $X, Total Travel Cost: $Y").
* 4.4.5 Membership Breakeven Analysis: For stores requiring membership, allow users to input their membership fee. The app can then display how many 'typical' saving transactions are needed to offset the fee, or the effective savings after accounting for the membership fee.
4.5 User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)
* Intuitive Design: Clean, modern, and easy-to-navigate interface.
* Responsive Layout: Optimized for both mobile and tablet devices.
* Clear Visualizations: Use charts, graphs, or color-coding to quickly convey savings, costs, and comparisons.
* Error Handling & Feedback: Clear messages for unavailable data, OCR errors, or network issues.
4.6 Data Persistence & Personalization
* User Accounts (Firebase Authentication): Allow users to sign in (anonymously or via Google/email) to save their grocery lists, "Your Usuals," vehicle details, and settings across devices.
o Firestore Database: Use Firestore for robust, real-time data storage.
* User-specific data (lists, usuals, vehicle info) stored privately: /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/...
* Potentially public/shared data (e.g., anonymized aggregated pricing insights, if implemented): /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/...
* Firebase Initial Auth Token: Implement signInWithCustomToken using __initial_auth_token for seamless authentication in the Canvas environment, falling back to signInAnonymously if not provided.
* Real-time Updates: Utilize Firestore's onSnapshot listeners to ensure the UI reflects changes instantly (e.g., when an item is added to the list, or pricing data updates).
5. Technical Requirements
5.1 APIs & Integrations
* Pricing Data API: A reliable API that provides grocery item prices across various retailers. A 1-day lag is acceptable. This is the most crucial external dependency.
* Geolocation/Mapping API: For identifying nearby stores, calculating distances, and travel times (e.g., Google Maps API).
* Gas Price API: To get current average gas prices in the user's vicinity.
* OCR API: For extracting text from receipt images (e.g., Klippa, Veryfi, Taggun).
* Product Database API: To lookup product details (name, brand, image) by UPC/EAN barcode.
5.2 Backend & Database
* Firebase/Firestore: As the primary backend for user data storage and real-time updates.
* Cloud Functions (Optional, but Recommended for complex logic): For backend logic like:
o Orchestrating calls to multiple external APIs (pricing, maps, gas).
o Complex optimization algorithms for split purchases.
o Anonymized data aggregation for future features.
5.3 AI and Machine Learning (ML) Stacks
The application will leverage AI and ML extensively for core functionalities, primarily in:
* Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Receipt Scanning:
o Purpose: To accurately extract structured data (store name, date, individual line items, prices) from images of physical receipts.
o ML Techniques: Deep learning models trained on large datasets of diverse grocery receipts. This involves:
* Image Pre-processing: Noise reduction, deskewing, binarization to improve text visibility.
* Text Detection: Identifying regions of text within the image.
* Text Recognition: Converting detected text regions into characters.
* Layout Analysis & Information Extraction: Understanding the spatial relationships between text blocks to identify product names, quantities, unit prices, and totals, even with varying receipt formats and abbreviations. This often involves sequence labeling models (e.g., using LSTMs or Transformers) trained to recognize common receipt fields.
o Suggested Stacks/Services:
* Cloud-based ML APIs: Google Cloud Vision AI (specifically Document AI for structured extraction), AWS Textract, Azure Cognitive Services. These provide pre-trained, highly accurate models.
* Specialized OCR APIs: Services like Veryfi, Klippa, Taggun, which are purpose-built for receipt and invoice processing and often offer higher accuracy for this specific domain.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Smart Clarification System:
o Purpose: To interpret generic user input ("Milk," "Bread") and intelligently suggest the most likely specific product, and to learn user preferences ("Your Usuals").
o ML Techniques:
* Fuzzy String Matching: To match user input to known product names in the database even with misspellings or variations.
* Embedding Models: To understand semantic similarity between generic terms and specific product descriptions (e.g., "Orange Juice" vs. "Minute Maid Pulp Free Orange Juice").
* Recommendation Systems: For "Your Usuals" and "Past Purchases," collaborative filtering or content-based filtering algorithms can learn user preferences over time to prioritize suggestions.
* Clustering/Classification: To group similar products (e.g., different types of "Milk") for the quick refinement panel.
o Suggested Stacks/Libraries:
* Python Libraries: scikit-learn (for clustering, basic classification), fuzzywuzzy (for string matching), spaCy or NLTK (for basic NLP tasks).
* Deep Learning Frameworks (if building custom models): TensorFlow, PyTorch for more advanced embedding and recommendation systems.
* Cloud AI Services: Google Cloud Natural Language API, AWS Comprehend, Azure Text Analytics (for entity extraction or sentiment if needed for other features).
* Data Annotation/Labeling (for custom ML training): If building custom OCR or NLP models (rather than relying solely on third-party APIs), a process for annotating receipts or product descriptions would be necessary to create training data.
5.4 Security & Privacy
* Authentication: Secure user authentication (Firebase Auth).
* Data Encryption: Ensure all user data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
* Privacy Policy: Clearly communicate data collection and usage practices to users.
* Firestore Security Rules: Implement robust security rules to ensure users can only access their own private data and permitted public data.
